//! Asynchronous task queue.
//!
//! This class implements a thread-safe task queue, allowing lock-free scheduling
//! of tasks for immediate or delayed execution on the background thread, as well
//! as lock-free task cancellation and re-scheduling (changing deadline).
//!
//! Note that those operations are lock-free only if core::Timer::try_set_deadline()
//! is so, which however is true on modern platforms.
//!
//! In the current implementation, priority is given to fast scheduling and cancellation
//! over the strict observance of the scheduling deadlines. In other words, during
//! contention or peak load, scheduling and cancellation will be always fast, but task
//! execution may be delayed.
//!
//! This design was considered acceptable because the actual task queue users are more
//! sensitive to delays than the tasks they schedule. The task queue is used by network
//! and pipeline threads, which should never block and use the task queue to schedule
//! low-priority delayed work.
//!
//! The implementation uses two queues internally:
//!
//!  - ready_queue_ - a lock-free queue of tasks of three kinds:
//!    - tasks to be executed as soon as possible (i.e. with zero deadline)
//!    - tasks to be re-scheduled with another deadline (renewed_deadline_ > 0)
//!    - tasks to be cancelled                          (renewed_deadline_ < 0)
//!
//!  - sleeping_queue_ - a sorted queue of tasks with non-zero deadline, scheduled for
//!    execution in future; the task at the head has the smallest (nearest) deadline;
//!
//! task_mutex_ should be acquired to process tasks and/or to access sleeping_queue_.
//!
//! wakeup_timer_ (core::Timer) is used to set or wait for the next wakeup time of the
//! background thread. This time is set to zero when ready_queue_ is non-empty, otherwise
//! it is set to the deadline of the first task in sleeping_queue_ if it's non-empty, and
//! otherwise is set to infinity (-1). The timer allows to update the deadline
//! concurrently from any thread.
//!
//! When the task is scheduled, re-scheduled, or cancelled, there are two ways to
//! complete the operation:
//!
//!  - If the event loop thread is sleeping and the task_mutex_ is free, we can acquire
//!    the mutex and complete the operation in-place by manipulating sleeping_queue_
//!    under the mutex.
//!
//!  - Otherwise, we push the task to ready_queue_ (which has lock-free push), set
//!    the timer wakeup time to zero (to ensure that the background thread wont go to
//!    sleep), and return, leaving the completion of the operarion to the background
//!    thread. The background will fetch the task from ready_queue_ soon and complete
//!    the operation by manipulating the sleeping_queue_.
//!
//! The current task state is defined by its atomic field "state_". Various task queue
//! operations move task from one state to another. The move is always performed using
//! atomic CAS or exchange to handle concurrent lock-free updates correctly.
//!
//! Here are some typical flows of the task states:
//! @code
//!    schedule():
//!      StateFinished -> StateInitializing -> StateReady
//!        -> StateProcessing -> StateFinishing -> StateFinished
//!
//!    schedule_at():
//!      StateFinished -> StateInitializing -> StateReady
//!        -> StateSleeping
//!        -> StateProcessing -> StateFinishing -> StateFinished
//!
//!    reschedule_at():
//!      [any state] -> StateReady
//!        -> StateSleeping
//!        -> StateProcessing -> StateFinishing -> StateFinished
//!
//!    async_cancel():
//!      StateSleeping -> StateReady
//!        -> StateCancelling -> StateFinishing -> StateFinished
//! @endcode
//!
//! The meaning of the states is the following:
//!  - StateInitializing: task is being initialized by schedule() or schedule_at()
//!  - StateReady: task is added to the ready queue for execution or renewal,
//!                or probably is currently being renewed in-place
//!  - StateSleeping: task renewal is complete and the task was put into the sleeping
//!                   queue because it was put to ready queue for re-scheduling
//!  - StateCancelling: task renewal is complete and the task is being cancelled
//!                     because it was put to ready queue for cancallation
//!  - StateProcessing: task is being processed after fetching it either from ready
//!                     queue (if it was put there for execution) or sleeping queue
//!  - StateFinishing: task processing is complete and the task is being finished
//!  - StateFinished: task is finished and is not used anywhere; it may be safely
//!                   destroyed; this is also the initial task state
