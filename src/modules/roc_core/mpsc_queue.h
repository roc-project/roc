//! Thread-safe lock-free node-based intrusive multi-producer single-consumer queue.
//!
//! Provides sequential consistency.

//! Based on Dmitry Vyukov algorithm:
//!  - http://tiny.cc/3d3moz
//!  - https://int08h.com/post/ode-to-a-vyukov-queue/
//!  - https://github.com/samanbarghi/MPSCQ

//! @tparam T defines object type, it should inherit MpscQueueNode.
//!
//! @tparam Ownership defines ownership policy which is used to acquire an element
//! ownership when it's added to the queue and release ownership when it's removed
//! from the queue.
template <class T, template <class TT> class Ownership = RefCntOwnership>

    //! After this call returns, any thread calling pop_front_exclusive() or
    //! try_pop_front_exclusive() is guaranteed to see a non-empty queue. But note
    //! that the latter can still fail if called concurrently with push_back().
    //! @note
    //!  - On CPUs with atomic exchange, e.g. x86, this operation is both lock-free
    //!    and wait-free, i.e. it never waits for sleeping threads and never spins.
    //!  - On CPUs without atomic exchange, e.g. arm64, this operation is lock-free,
    //!    but not wait-free, i.e. it never waits for sleeping threads, but with a low
    //!    probability can spin while there are concurrent non-sleeping push_back()
    //!    calls (because of the spin loop in the implementation of atomic exchange).
    //!  - Concurrent try_pop_front() and pop_front() does not affect this operation.
    //!    Only concurrent push_back() calls can make it spin.

    //!  - Returns NULL if the queue is empty.
    //!  - May return NULL even if the queue is actially non-empty, in particular if
    //!    concurrent push_back() call is running, or if the push_back() results were
    //!    not fully published yet.
    //! @note

    //!    never waits for sleeping threads and never spins indefinitely.
