GitHub
======

We use `GitHub <https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-toolkit>`_ for bug tracking and code review. Feel free to file an issue to report a bug, suggest a feature, or discuss an idea. Pull requests are welcome as well; see :doc:`/development/contribution_guidelines`.

Mailing list
============

We have an announcement and discussion mailing list for users and developers: roc@freelists.org. It is the recommended place for extensive discussions and troubleshooting.

You can browse the list archive and join the list by visiting `this page <https://www.freelists.org/list/roc>`__. You can also join the list by sending an email to roc-request@freelists.org with "subscribe" in the "Subject" field. You need to join to be able to post.

.. note::

   Please use `bottom-posting <http://www.idallen.com/topposting.html>`_ on the mailing list.

IRC
===

We also have an IRC channel for more interactive discussion. Point your client to ``chat.freenode.net`` and then join the ``#rocstreaming`` channel. Alternately, you can connect using `a web client <https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=rocstreaming>`_.

You can browse the IRC archives on `this page <https://freenode.logbot.info/rocstreaming/>`__.

.. note::

   If you want to be able to see messages sent to the channel when you **were offline**, you can use Matrix.org IRC bridge. You can `connect to the channel <https://app.element.io/#/room/#freenode_#rocstreaming:matrix.org>`_ using Element web client or other `Matrix clients <https://matrix.org/clients/>`_. You'll need to setup a Matrix account and enter the room.
